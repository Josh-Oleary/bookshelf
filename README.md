MyReads is a SPA created using React. Users have the ability to search for books (in the Udacity database) and change the state of the book via a dropdown menu. The state of the book is the same throughout the entire application. The application was built from scratch. Udacity's database and API were utilized on the back-end. 

Default book image was taken from 'ukrgate.com'
